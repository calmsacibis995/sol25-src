 * Things used to handle special PostScript requests (like manual feed) globally
 * or on a per page basis. All the translators I've supplied accept the -R option
 * that can be used to insert special PostScript code before the global setup is
 * done, or at the start of named pages. The argument to the -R option is a string
 * that can be "request", "request:page", or "request:page:file". If page isn't
 * given (as in the first form) or if it's 0 in the last two, the request applies
 * to the global environment, otherwise request holds only for the named page.
 * If a file name is given a page number must be supplied, and in that case the
 * request will be looked up in that file.
