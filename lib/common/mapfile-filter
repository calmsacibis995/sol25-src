# Default mapfile for optimizing the creation of a filter shared object.
#
# Create a single read-only, executable text segment to catch all loadable
# sections.  Although most filters can be built directly from ld(1) (so that no
# .init/.fini sections are created), and only require to be read-only, the
# execute attribute is maintained to provide for .init processing where
# necessary (also, older versions of dbx give warning messages if they find
# objects without traditional text segments).
#
# This compaction of a filter into a single segment allows ld.so.1 to optimize
# its processing for a filter.  If the filter is small enough this segment
# may be handled in a single page mapping (libdl.so.1).
#
# The assignment of all allocatable sections to this segment insures that the
# .dynamic, and any .data or .bss sections, become part of the text.  Note that
# the compiler has a habit of generating empty .data and .bss sections.

filter = LOAD ?RX;
filter : ?A;
